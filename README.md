# Deployment_SVM-model

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
## Utilize histograms, box plots, or density plots to understand feature distributions
## Employ scatter plots, pair plots, or relevant visualizations to comprehend feature distributions and relationships.
## Visualize class distributions to gauge dataset balance or imbalance.
## Implement a basic SVM classifier using Python libraries like scikit-learn.
## Train the SVM model on the training data.
## Evaluate model performance on the testing data using appropriate metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score).

# Visualize classification results on the testing data (plot decision boundaries)

## Parameter Tuning and Optimization
## Compare SVM performance with various kernels (e.g., linear, polynomial, radial basis function).
## Analyze SVM strengths and weaknesses for the Mushroom dataset based on EDA and visualization results.
## Discuss practical implications of SVM in real-world classification tasks.
